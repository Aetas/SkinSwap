# SkinSwap
A weird name - it's just for swapping texture files (skins) for a Vive wand. And an excuse to do file things in Python because I need practice. Python. Bleh.

## Need to clean'er up and do that documentation thing.

Which is really boring so who knows when I'll get around to it.

I also need to make an installer script of clean up (aka decide on) my file structure. Putting the script in src means it wont see the .log or .ref files I told it to open. But since one is append and the other is read+write, they should be created in the ./src/ directory just fine.  
But this will introduce the other problem of finding the skins folder so I digress.
